# UBC Perimeter Controller
**Course**: CPSC221, UBC, Introduction to data structures and algorithms
**Desc:** UBC has decided that its students can be more productive if, like grazing farm animals, they are not allowedGraham scan to wander too far away from their classrooms on campus. In order to enforce this, each student is equipped with an electronic armband which interacts with a laser perimeter which prevents the student from leaving their designated classroom area.
**Algorithms Used:** Graham scan, Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm (usefull for computational geometry), Sorting
**Data Structures Used:** Stacks and Vectors (dynamic arrays)
